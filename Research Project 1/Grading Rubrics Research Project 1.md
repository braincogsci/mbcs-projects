## Introduction
These are the rubrics used to assess _Research Project 1_. There are two things worth emphasizing about these rubrics:

1. The weights of the aspects within each individual rubric are not predefined.
2. The normative descriptions are abstracted and might require reinterpration for any given project.

Both these points can be explained by the diverse range of projects that are performed by students from the research master *Brain and Cognitive Sciences*. Different disciplines will place different requirements on student performance. Still, we believe that the use of rubrics contributes to comparable assessment of all students within the programme, regardless of their field or hosting lab.

## Rubrics
There are three rubrics, corresponding to the three graded components: process, written report and oral presention.

### Process
Process counts towards 40% of the final mark and can only be assessed by the internal assessor of the project.

|Aspect|Poor (<4)|Not sufficient (4-5)|Sufficient (6)|Good (7-8)|Excellent (9-10)|
|:--|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|Collecting literature|The student did not collect literature and had no or very limited understanding of the context of the project.|The student did not manage to collect and evaluate appropriate literature in time, leading to an incomplete understanding of the context of the project. This hampered performance on the project as a whole.|The student collected relevant literature, but did not arrive at a demonstrable, full understanding of the theory that was relevant to this project. This prevented the student from fully motivating all the important choices relevant to the research question and experimental design.|The student collected and evaluated relevant literature, leading to a good understanding of the theoretical framework and empirical space in which the project took place. The student can motivate the choice of research questions and important design choices.	|The student collected literature that was relevant for the research project, critically assessed this literature and obtained a strong overview of both the theoretical framework and empirical space in which the research project took place. The student can clearly argue what the value of the research question under consideration is, and can motivate all steps in the experimental design. Moreover, the student is capable of comparing the approach taken within the project with those in peer-reviewed literature.|
|Experimental skills|The student has failed to consistently display proficiency in the relevant experimental skills, even under supervision.|Experimental work done by the student is not efficient, either because of low accuracy, low speed or the requirement of intensive supervision.|The student learned to employ the techniques that were necessary to gather data, but there is considerate room for improvement with regards to timeliness or accuracy or the student lacks sufficient understanding of the principles behind the techniques.|The student worked in a timely and accurate fashion when applying the techniques relevant to this project. The student has a good idea of how the techniques work and what their principles are, but is not yet able to apply them independently or in a novel setting.|The student mastered the techniques that were necessary to gather data and understands their principles and their scope of applicability. The student works timely and accurately when doing such experimental work.|
|Data Analysis|The student did not demonstrate the ability to perform data analysis steps relevant to the project.|The student is not yet able to select a data analysis method and/or cannot analyze and interpret results without step-by-step supervision.|The student is able to select appropriate data analysis methods for acquired data in the domain of the research project and is also able to analyze and interpret the results, but still requires considerable supervision to do so, and is not capable of motivating important choices during the analysis.|The student is able to select appropriate data analysis methods for acquired data in the domain of the research project. The student has shown a good understanding of the workings of the analysis methods and is able to analyze and interpret results independently.|The student is able to select appropriate data analysis methods for acquired data in the domain of the research project, and can provide clear argumentation to support a choice. The student is able to perform analysis and interpret the results critically, while relatively unsupervised.||
|Learning skills|The student did not take ownership of the project and showed little effort or motivation to move it forward.|The learning process of the student was unnecessarily hindered for a long time and/or the student could not be relied upon when agreements or deadlines were set. Feedback had little effect to improve the learning of the student.|The student stayed in control of the learning process, seeking out information independently or by asking questions. However, the learning process was unnecessarily hindered at times and/or the student had difficulties upholding agreements and deadlines.|The student showed initiative in learning, seeking out information independently or by asking questions. The student responded well to feedback and upheld agreements and deadlines.|The student has demonstrated to be inquisitive during the learning process, keeping the right balance between asking questions and learning independently. The student upheld agreements and deadlines, responded well to feedback and took initiative to structure the internship, set personal goals and optimize learning.|
|Original contribution|Even if instructed or prompted, the student took little initiative to improve on the work.|Throughout the project, the student mostly followed instructions with regards to experimental design, data analysis and interpretation. The student did not bring in any substantial ideas for the project.|The student demonstrated the ability to make choices for the experimental design, data analysis and interpretation of results, but only when prompted by the supervisor.|The student demonstrated the ability to formulate good hypotheses and make design choices independently, in collaboration with the supervisor.|The student can formulate good hypotheses and make design choices independently, and can articulate (good) reasoning behind those choices. The student came up with original insights or ideas that clearly aided data collection, analysis or interpretation.|
|Collaboration|The student's attitude or behaviour during the project negatively influenced the work of others on a regular basis.|The student does not clearly keep the larger goal of the group and the objectives of colleagues in mind when working and has failed to consider the tasks and schedules of others on multiple occassions. Contributions to the group were limited and required prompting.|The student is aware of the larger goals of the group and of the objectives of colleagues, but still did not show significant contribution to the group.|The student is clearly aware of the larger goal of the group and the objectives of colleagues. The student organized the project work in such a way that it contributed to reaching those goals and objectives. The student contributed to group discussions.|The student is clearly aware of the larger goals of the group and the objectives of colleagues. The student contributed to reaching those goals and objectives via the research project, and also by helping out others and working in the interest of the group as a whole.|
|Independence|Even after the halfway point of the project, the student needed step-by-step instructions on tasks that had been performed regularly before.|The student could perform some tasks independently after instruction, but there were also key aspects of the projects that required more supervision/guidance than is common for a master student throughout the project.|The student showed increasing autonomy as the project progressed and is currently able to perform project-relevant tasks without supervision.|The student quickly mastered project-relevant tasks and managed to work with relatively little supervision.|The student did not only work independently on project-specific tasks, but displayed adaptive thinking and decision-making while doing so.|

# Using the rubrics
To assess work using the rubrics, first determine how much weight you'd give each aspect in the respective rubric. Once you have determined this, pick the normative descriptions that best describe the level of the work for each aspect. When doing so, you will end up in a specific column for each aspect, which corresponds to a bandwidth of grades. You have discretion to choose the lower bound, the upper bound or somewhere else within this bandwidth.

Once you have determined all the grades, you can use the weights of the aspects to arrive at a partial marks per rubric. These partial marks per rubric are then averaged according to preset weights, to arrive at a final mark: 50% written work, 40% process and 10% presentation.

You can fill in the rubrics on the [[../Miscellaneous/Datanose project page|Datanose project page]] of the Research Project, once the time to assess has come (i.e. once the student has submitted the report).

# Dutch grading system
The Dutch grading system scores on a 1-10 scale, with 6 being the minimum pass mark. See the following website for more information: https://www.nuffic.nl/en/education-systems/netherlands/grading-systems.

The University of Amsterdam has listed how the different grades in the Dutch system compare to international standards. This list can be found here: https://student.uva.nl/en/topics/the-marking-assessment-and-registration-of-your-academic-results

Note that works that score higher than 8.0 are remarkable and that the grade 9 is reserved for the top 3% of students, while only the top 0.5% scores 10.
