## Introduction
These are the rubrics used to assess _Research Project 1_. There are two things worth emphasizing about these rubrics:

1. The weights of the aspects within each individual rubric are not predefined.
2. The normative descriptions are abstracted and might require reinterpration for any given project.

Both these points can be explained by the diverse range of projects that are performed by students from the research master *Brain and Cognitive Sciences*. Different disciplines will place different requirements on student performance. Still, we believe that the use of rubrics contributes to comparable assessment of all students within the programme, regardless of their field or hosting lab.

## Rubrics
There are three rubrics, corresponding to the three graded components: process, written report and oral presention.

### Process
Process counts towards 40% of the final mark and can only be assessed by the internal assessor of the project.

| Collecting literature | The student did not engage with academic literature or demonstrated negligible understanding of the research project's context. This severely hindered their ability to comprehend the project's purpose or contribute meaningfully.                                                                                                                                                                | The student struggled to independently collect and/or critically evaluate appropriate literature in a timely manner. This resulted in an incomplete or superficial understanding of the project's context, as evidenced by interactions with the supervisor and negative impact on project performance. They lacked self-reliance in identifying key academic resources.                          | The student managed to collect relevant literature, demonstrating a basic understanding of the research context. However, their theoretical understanding remained somewhat superficial, limiting their ability to critically evaluate important research tasks, design choices, or the broader implications of their work. Independent synthesis of the literature was limited.                                                                                               | The student independently collected and evaluated relevant literature, leading to a comprehensive understanding of both the theoretical framework and the empirical landscape surrounding the research project. This robust understanding allowed them to grasp the relevance of project tasks, and justify their research questions and significant design choices based on existing knowledge.                                                                                                           | The student demonstrated self-reliance and critical acumen in collecting and evaluating academic literature. They developed a nuanced overview of both the theoretical framework and the empirical state-of-the-art relevant to the research project. This understanding enabled them to justify all research project steps with clear academic grounding, and  compare their project's approach with current methodologies found in peer-reviewed literature.                                                                                                                      |     |
| Experimental skills   | The student has failed to consistently show proficiency in the relevant experimental skills, even under supervision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Experimental work done by the student is not efficient, either because of low accuracy, low speed or the requirement of intensive supervision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | The student learned to employ technique(s) relevant to this project, but important elements of proficiency are still missing. Example elements are timeliness, accuracy, or demonstrated understanding of the principles behind the technique(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | The student worked in a timely and accurate fashion when applying technique(s) relevant to this project. The student has a good idea of how the techniques work and what their principles are, but is not yet able to apply them independently or in a novel setting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | The student mastered the technique(s) relevant to this research project and understands their principles and their scope of applicability. The student works timely and accurately when doing experimental work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |     |
| Data Analysis         | The student did not demonstrate the ability to perform data analysis steps relevant to the project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | The student struggles significantly with data analysis. They may not be able to select an appropriate method or, if a method is provided, cannot execute the analysis or interpret results without constant, step-by-step supervision. There's limited or no understanding of the method's principles or the meaning of the outputs.                                                              | The student is capable of selecting appropriate data analysis methods for the acquired data within the research project's domain. They can perform the analysis and derive interpretations, but this process requires considerable supervision. They frequently struggle to justify key analytical choices (e.g., choice of statistical test, handling of outliers, model selection) and may present interpretations without sufficient critical reflection on their validity. | The student demonstrates a solid ability to select appropriate data analysis methods for the acquired data within the research project's domain, providing sound reasoning for their choices. They have a good conceptual and practical understanding of the chosen analysis methods. They can independently perform the analysis, accurately interpret results, and articulate the implications of their findings. The student generally demonstrates awareness of potential limitations of the analysis. | The student exhibits exceptional proficiency in data analysis. They not only select the most appropriate data analysis methods for the acquired data, providing clear, well-argued justifications for all critical choices, but also demonstrate mastery of these methods. They can independently execute complex analyses, critically evaluate and interpret results within the broader context of the research, and proactively identify and address potential biases, assumptions, or limitations of their approach. Their analysis supports robust, evidence-based conclusions. |     |
| Learning skills       | The student demonstrates significant difficulty in acquiring new knowledge or skills independently. They frequently rely on constant instruction and struggle to grasp new concepts or techniques relevant to the project, showing resistance to feedback or new approaches. Progress is severely hampered by an inability to overcome learning obstacles, indicating low ownership of the project. | The student shows limited initiative in acquiring new knowledge or skills. They may attempt to learn but often require significant guidance and explicit step-by-step instructions. They struggle to effectively identify necessary resources or apply new concepts without direct prompting, and may only partially integrate feedback. They are slow to adapt to new information or challenges. | The student demonstrates a willingness to learn new skills and acquire necessary knowledge, often seeking guidance when encountering difficulties. They can identify some relevant resources and apply newly learned concepts with moderate supervision. They generally integrate feedback, and can adapt to minor changes or new information, but may struggle with more complex or unexpected learning challenges independently.                                             | The student actively seeks out and effectively acquires new knowledge and skills required for the project. They demonstrate resourcefulness in finding and utilizing appropriate learning materials and tools (e.g., tutorials, documentation, expert advice). They are generally quick to integrate feedback, adapt to unforeseen challenges or changes in the project direction, and independently apply new concepts to solve emerging problems.                                                        | The student demonstrates exceptional proactive learning and adaptability throughout the project. They independently identify knowledge gaps or skill requirements, and master new complex concepts or techniques with the right balance between independence and asking questions. They are resourceful, leveraging self-directed thinking to overcome significant challenges. They consistently and thoughtfully integrate feedback, rapidly adapt, and work independently, taking full ownership of the project.                                                                  |     |
| Original contribution | The student demonstrated minimal or no initiative to contribute original ideas or improve the work, even when prompted or instructed. The project primarily reflects the supervisor's direction, with the student acting as a passive implementer.                                                                                                                                                  | Throughout the project, the student primarily followed instructions regarding experimental design, data collection, analysis, and interpretation. While tasks were completed, the student rarely contributed substantial independent ideas, insights, or modifications to the project's direction or execution.                                                                                   | The student demonstrated the ability to make informed choices regarding experimental design, data analysis, and interpretation of results, but typically only when directly prompted or guided by the supervisor. They could articulate reasoning for these choices once a direction was suggested, but lacked consistent proactive ideation.                                                                                                                                  | The student consistently demonstrated the ability to make decisions about the projects independently, often initiating discussions with the supervisor to refine these ideas. They contributed valuable, independent thoughts for experimental setup, analytical approaches, or interpretation, actively shaping significant aspects of the project.                                                                                                                                                       | The student displayed exceptional initiative and made significant original contributions to the project. E.g. they formulated insightful hypotheses,  conceived and articulated well-reasoned design choices or consistently brought forward novel ideas that demonstrably enhanced data collection, analysis, or interpretation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |     |


### Technical report
The [[./Technical report|Technical report]] counts towards 50% of the final mark and is assessed by both the internal and the external assessor of the project.

|Aspect|Poor (<4)|Not sufficient (4-5)|Sufficient (6)|Good (7-8)|Excellent (9-10)|
|:--|:----|:----|:--|:----|:----|
| Structure of the report                  | Sections are poorly defined, illogical or entirely absent, leading to a fragmented report. The connections between ideas are unclear or non-existent and the reader struggles to follow the overall argument or purpose.        | While somewhat coherent, the report deviates significantly from the technical report template or an alternative logical flow. Sections may be present, but are not always coherent or internal organisation is confusing. Understanding the connections between elements in the text requires too much effort from the reader.                        | The report adheres to a recognizable technical report template or employs a logical, consistent structure that generally serves the report's purpose. Main sections are present and ordered acceptably. While generally understandable, transitions between sections or ideas may sometimes be abrupt or require minor effort from the reader.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | The structure of the report actively supports comprehension and guides the reader through the content.

# Using the rubrics
To assess work using the rubrics, first determine how much weight you'd give each aspect in the respective rubric. Once you have determined this, pick the normative descriptions that best describe the level of the work for each aspect. When doing so, you will end up in a specific column for each aspect, which corresponds to a bandwidth of grades. You have discretion to choose the lower bound, the upper bound or somewhere else within this bandwidth.

Once you have determined all the grades, you can use the weights of the aspects to arrive at a partial marks per rubric. These partial marks per rubric are then averaged according to preset weights, to arrive at a final mark: 50% written work, 40% process and 10% presentation.

You can fill in the rubrics on the [[../Miscellaneous/Datanose project page|Datanose project page]] of the Research Project, once the time to assess has come (i.e. once the student has submitted the report).

# Dutch grading system
The Dutch grading system scores on a 1-10 scale, with 6 being the minimum pass mark. See the following website for more information: https://www.nuffic.nl/en/education-systems/netherlands/grading-systems.

The University of Amsterdam has listed how the different grades in the Dutch system compare to international standards. This list can be found here: https://student.uva.nl/en/topics/the-marking-assessment-and-registration-of-your-academic-results

Note that works that score higher than 8.0 are remarkable and that the grade 9 is reserved for the top 3% of students, while only the top 0.5% scores 10.

# Disclosure of GenAI use
The above rubrics were created with the help of GenAI (UvA AI Chat, using ``gpt-3.5-turbo``). The purpose of this use was to rephrase descriptions and to ensure different levels of performance were sufficiently differentiated. The overall process of generation consisted of:

1. Manual writing of the rubrics
2. Row-by-row rephrasing using UvA AI Chat
3. Manual review and revision of the Gen-AI assisted formulations

The prompting used for rephrasing was as follows.
