After each research project, the student concludes with a report on the work that was done. For [[./Research Project 1 Manual|Research Project 1]], the report takes the form of a technical report. A technical report clearly communicates the findings from the project, provides recommendations for next steps and is readable at a glance for those with an interest in the project.

## Template

The following structure is recommended for writing a technical report.

### Title page

Add a title page following the conventions listed here:

https://www.mbcs-projects.nl/Miscellaneous/Formatting+and+Publication+Guidelines#Cover+page

### Summary
Provide an overview of what you did, what you found and what you recommend on the basis of your findings.

### Table of contents
To make the report readable at a glance, help the reader to navigate your document by using numbered headers, which you refer to in a table of contents.

### Introduction
Similar to the introduction in a research article, the introduction in a technical report provides context for your study. Explain:

- The aims of your study (including any hypotheses)
- The overarching research question that can be answered via the study
- The scientific justification of this research question

Note that the  aims of the study can include testing a methodology, developing an analysis method, performing a pilot, etc.

You can also mention any particular constraints you faced (e.g. limited access to participants or technology).

### Methods
Briefly describe the methods you used to perform your study. Use sections to differentiate between experiments where appropriate. Be succinct and cite more extensive descriptions of the paradigms in your study, or add them as an appendix.

If a paradigm or research design is difficult to convey, make use of graphical illustrations to allow readers to quickly understand the setup of the study.

### Results
Provide descriptions of your results. Use tables and figures to clearly communicate important outcomes. Make sure that tables, figures and equations are numbered and referred to in-text. 

### Conclusions
Repeat the aim of the study and conclude whether or not this aim was achieved on the basis of your findings. Clearly explain how you reach that conclusion.
### Ethical considerations
Identify the ethical considerations surrounding your project. Use the [[../Miscellaneous/Three Tier Model of Scientific Ethics|Three Tier Model of Scientific Ethics]] to help with your exploration.

### Recommendations
Make recommendations for next steps (e.g. follow-up research, alterations to a pilot setup, resolutions to ethical challenges).
### GenAI statement
A distinct section detailing any use of GenAI tools during the research process or writing of the report.

### References
A list of references used in the prior sections.

### Appendices
In case you have findings, raw data or detailed method descriptions that would distract from efficient communication in the preceding sections, place them as numbered appendices. Make sure you refer to appendices in-text in the relevant preceding sections.
