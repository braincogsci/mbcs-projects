The individual projects (i.e. *Research Project 1*, *Research Project 2* and *Literature Thesis*) lead to written works of different kinds:

- A technical report for *Research Project 1*
- A journal article for *Research Project 2*
- A review paper for *Literature Thesis*

The exact formatting and citation style can follow that of a respectable journal within the field of enquiry of the student. It is at the discretion of the student a supervisor to decide which journal to use. Yet for all written works, there are a few constraints.

## Cover page
For all projects, the written work must be submitted via the respective [[./Datanose project page|Datanose project page]] with a single cover page that includes:

- The title of the written work

- A designation of the specific project type
- The name and affiliation of the programme (research master *Brain and Cognitive Sciences* at the University of Amsterdam)
- The date of submission
- The names and affiliations of all other parties involved in the work, as well as their roles:
	- Supervisor

	- Examiner

An example cover page has been posted to the programme Canvas page.
