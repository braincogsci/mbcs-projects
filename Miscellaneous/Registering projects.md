Each of the individual projects taught within MBCS should be registered on Datanose. This is an action that should be performed by the student.
## Overall process
- Student heads to www.datanose.nl/#yourprojects
- Picks the corresponding project
- Fills in the details of the project

Registration includes a title for the project, as well as the staff that will be involved in supervision and assessment of the project and their affiliations. Registration also requires submission of the time period in which the project should take place.

Once a student has submitted a project registration, two things happen:

1. The programme reviews the information to check whether the project fits with the scope and requirements of MBCS.
2. The examiner that was listed during the registration confirms agreement to fulfilling that role.

Approval of the project means it is eligible for inclusion into the curriculum section of the student's Study Plan and is a formal part of the programme.

## Notes on registering Research Projects

During registration of research projects, the student provides an indication of the project's topic and timeline, as well as who will be [[./Examiner|examiner]] and who will be assessor. The student attached the work agreement from the [[./Intake Meeting|Intake Meeting]] as a comment attachment on the project page.

>[!caution] Attention!
>Care should be taken when registering the project as *internal* (at UvA) or *external* (outside of UvA):
>
>In the case of *internal* projects, Datanose will assume the examiner is able to grade experimental work, presentation and written work. 
>
>In the case of *external* projects, Datanose will assume the examiner can only assess the written work.

## Research proposal

One month after the **starting date** of the project (not to be confused with the registration date), the student is expected to submit a proposal that delineates the content and the planning of the project. See the following manual for more information:

- [[../Research Project 1/Research Project 1 Manual|Research Project 1 Manual]]
- [[../Research Project 2/Research Project 2 Manual|Research Project 2 Manual]]

## Uploading internship agreement
If you do your research project outside of UvA, you will need to sign an internship agreement. This agreement, formulated by the Universities of the Netherlands together with representatives from industry, exists to handle non-disclosure agreement and intellectual property clauses.
