The individual projects (i.e. *Research Project 1*, *Research Project 2* and *Literature Thesis*) lead to written works of different kinds:

- A technical report for *Research Project 1*
- A journal article for *Research Project 2*
- A review paper for *Literature Thesis*

The exact formatting and citation style can follow that of a respectable journal within the field of enquiry of the student. It is at the discretion of the student a supervisor to decide which journal to use. Yet for all written works, there are a few constraints.
## Cover page
For all projects, the written work must be submitted via the respective [[./Datanose project page|Datanose project page]] with a single cover page that includes:

- The title of the written work
- The name of the student submitting the work, including UvA student number
- A designation of the specific project type
- The name and affiliation of the programme (research master *Brain and Cognitive Sciences* at the University of Amsterdam)
- The date of submission
- The names and affiliations of all other parties involved in the work, as well as their roles:
	- Supervisor
	- Assessor
	- Examiner

An example cover page has been posted to the programme Canvas page.

## Publishing work
In some cases, there will be the possibility to submit your Literature Thesis or Research Project report in a scientific journal. This is something we wholly encourage, but please note the following:

- The work you submit for assessment in MBCS needs to written by you, as it used as a measure of your individual performance
- Publishing takes a more collaborative approach, where your co-authors will also produce the work

Taken together, it makes sense to write your report and then _rewrite_ it for publication with any co-authors.
