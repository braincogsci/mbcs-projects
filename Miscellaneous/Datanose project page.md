All registered individual projects have their own project page on the website www.datanose.nl. Students create and review their projects via www.datanose.nl/#yourprojects. 

## Project registration
To create a project page, the student needs to first register a project. This is ideally done one month before the project actually starts, but it can technically be done up until one month after the starting date. 

After registration, both programme and examiner need to approve the project. Without such approval, the project cannot be part of the MBCS curriculum, which is why registering it in advance of starting is a best practice.

Once a project is registered, a URL is created that can be accessed by all relevant parties for each step in the process. Datanose keeps the parties updated on required steps via email notifications.

## Proposal submission
This step only applies to *Research Project 1* and *Research Project 2*. After registration and approval, the student can submit a research proposal via an online form on the project page. It is possible to work on this and return to it later online. Within a month of the project starting date, the student should submit the proposal for review. It is then checked by programme and examiner, to assess whether the project is feasible and within the scope of the master's programme.

## Submission of final work
The project page offers the student a dialog to submit the final version of the report, which is written at the end stage of the project. Datanose will generate an automatic plagiarism report, which is accessible by examiner and assessor, as well as by the programme and Examinations Board.

Submitting the final work also triggers the assessment phase. Assessor and examiner will be invited via e-mail to assess the submitted work by filling in the respective rubrics.

## Other comments

Note that:

- Each project has a unique URL, which can be accessed by all relevant parties. The page will adapt to your particular role (when logged in). This means that if anyone loses the project link as sent via e-mail, the student can relocate the link by navigating to their project via Datanose.nl.
- The rubrics of the individual projects only appear on Datanose once the time for assessment has come. To view the rubrics in advance (useful for students, but also for those preparing the [[./Midterm Evaluation|Midterm Evaluation]]), please see:
	- [[../Research Project 1/Grading Rubrics Research Project 1|Grading Rubrics Research Project 1]]

- All comments placed on the Datanose project page are visible to all parties, whether assessors, student or programme management.
- You can use the comments to add attachments to your page, such as the work agreement that was filled in after one of the [[./Intake Meeting|Intake Meeting]].
