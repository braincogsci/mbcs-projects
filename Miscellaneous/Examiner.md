In the context of individual projects for the research master Brain and Cognitive Sciences, one of the two project assessor is also labeled examiner. The examiner takes on some extra responsibilities for the project:

- The examiner monitors whether the project is of good scientific quality.
- The examiner checks whether the assessment of the project meets the standards of the University of Amsterdam.
- The examiner verifies and registers the final mark for the project.

These responsibilities mean slightly different things for each of the three capstones, but the requirement for being an examiner are the same for all three:

- The examiner must have a doctoral degree (PhD)
- The examiner must be employed at UvA
- The examiner must be in the possession of a University Teaching Qualification (UTQ, or BKO)

In addition to these three, there is the expectation that the examiner has expertise that is relevant to the project.
