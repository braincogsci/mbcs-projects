You can use the following grading rubrics to determine the quality of the submitted Literature Thesis. Please note that the relative weights of the different criteria are fixed. For more information on the Literature Thesis, see the [[./Literature Thesis Manual|Literature Thesis Manual]].

To use the rubric, choose the description that most closely matches a description of the work that is being assessed. Note that from sufficient onwards, the higher performance descriptions include meeting the standards of lower levels. 

The column headers list a qualitative description of the level of work. These descriptors map onto a range of grades. The low end of this range corresponds to only just meeting the norms in the respective column, while the high end corresponds to clearly meeting those norms, but not yet the norms of the subsequent column. For more on the ranges, see the section *Dutch grading system below.*

Process is only assessed by the assessor who was closely involved with the writing process (the examiner in case of internal projects, the assessor in case of external projects). The thesis is assessed by both assessors. The final mark consists of the weighted average of process (10%) and thesis (90%). The grade for the thesis is the average of the grades given by the assessor, but please be mindful that the assessors may not allot grade points with a different of 1 point or more.

## Process

|Criterion|Poor|Insufficient|Sufficient|Good|Excellent| 
|:--- |:----:|:----:|:---:|:---: |:----:|
|Process (100%)|The process did not meet the standards for sufficient performance by far, or cannot be assessed due to other reasons.|The process did not meet the standards for sufficient performance, but also was not poor.|The process went smoothly with regards to deadlines, communication and collaboration.|In addition, the student took a proactive stance towards work that needed to be done and problems that needed to be solved.|In addition, the problem-solving by the student showed a level of creativity and independence that would be expected from students in a doctoral (PhD) programme.|

| Writing (3%)              |                                                                                                              The quality of the writing is too low to meaningfully assess the work as a whole.                                                                                                               |                                                                 The quality of the writing in the final version of the thesis does not meet the standards for sufficient performance, but the work could still be assessed.                                                                  |                                                                                                                                       The final version of the thesis is written in good academic English and is structured very well. Writing is parsimonious and clear at all times.                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                        In addition, the thesis makes effective and efficient use of explanatory graphs and figures.                                                                                                                         |                                                                                       In addition, the writing is at such a level that it could be submitted for publication as-is.                                                                                        |     |
| Content (35%)             | The sources used for the writing of the literature thesis were too few, of too low quality or not relevant enough for the problem at hand to meet the standards for sufficient performance. Alternatively, the thesis does not demonstrate a solid understanding of the scientific literature that was used. |                                                           The thesis sets out a coherent line of thought, based on accurate interpretations and understanding of existing literature, but leaves out important relevant findings.                                                             |                                                     The thesis sets out a coherent line of thought and gives an accurate interpretation of existing, relevant scientific literature, while covering the findings that are most relevant to the problem statement. The thesis demonstrates a solid understanding of the subject material and makes a serious effort to address the central problem.                                                     |                                                                                                      In addition, the content of the thesis is focused on resolution of the central problem statement. Claims are substantiated and properly sourced.                                                                                                      | In addition, the literature thesis used sources from a variety of disciplines and neatly brought them together, leading to an exhaustive overview and resolution of the problem statement that would warrant publication in a respectable journal in the respective field. |     |
| Problem statement (10%)   |                                There is no clear description of the problem that the thesis tries to address, there are inaccuracies in the discussion of existing literature or context is lacking to understand the relevance and/or key concepts that are to be explored.                                 |                                                                                                  The problem statement does not meet the requirements for a sufficient score, but is close.                                                                                                  | The problem statement is defined clearly and succinctly, and key concepts from relevant scientific literature as well as operational definitions are reviewed and explained well, to elaborate on the problem and the current state of knowledge. The problem statement is arguable and important (i.e. warrants an extensive, critical examination of current research) and can be explored in two months of full-time work. |                                                                                                 In addition, the importance of the problem statement is underlined by making the scientific and societal value of its resolution explicit.                                                                                                  |                                     In addition, the resolution of the problem statement would make a highly valuable contribution to progress in the field and would be publishable in a respectable journal in the respective field.                                     |     |
| Critical thinking (30%)   |                                                                The critical examination of the literature addressed in the thesis did not meet the standards for sufficient performance or could not be assessed (e.g. due to poor writing).                                                                 |                                                                  The thesis critically evaluates some of the research findings, but only minimally examines underlying assumptions and mostly takes a singular perspective.                                                                  |                                                                                       The thesis critically evaluates important research findings that are relevant to the problem statement and examines underlying assumptions. It gives due consideration to literature that runs counter to its position on the problem statement.                                                                                        | In addition, the thesis takes a clear position with regards to the problem statement. This position results from the critical, reasoned comparison of multiple explanations. The assumptions underlying this position are made explicit and important claims made in the thesis are substantiated using logical reasoning and explanations. |               In addition, this substantiated position is argued for so persuasively that it shifts the thinking of the reader, adding original thought through critical analysis. The reader becomes aware of (questionable) assumptions in the literature.               |     |
| Interdisciplinarity (22%) |                                                                          There is hardly any attempt to integrate insights from different disciplines, whether in the body of the text or in a separate interdisciplinary section.                                                                           | The topic of the thesis is meaningfully addressed using a variety of disciplinary perspectives, or the thesis persuasively argues for the impact of the thesis' findings on other disciplines. This happens either within the body of the thesis or in a separate interdisciplinary section. |                                                                                    The thesis (or interdisciplinary section) shows how the problem statement is relevant to multiple disciplines. It clarifies or demonstrates which insights or approaches from different disciplines can be used to help resolve the problem statement.                                                                                     |  In addition, the thesis integrates insights from different disciplines to yield an interdisciplinary view on the topic. This can be done by explaining phenomena from one discipline in terms of phenomena from other disciplines, or by contrasting insights from different disciplines and explaining where the differences come from.   |                                                          In addition, the literature thesis identifies which tensions between the view of different disciplines remain and how future research can resolve them.                                                           |     |

# Dutch grading system
The Dutch grading system scores on a 1-10 scale, with 6 being the minimum pass mark. See the following website for more information: https://www.nuffic.nl/en/education-systems/netherlands/grading-systems

The qualitative descriptors (Poor, Insufficient, Sufficient, etc.) from the rubric map onto multiple possible numerical values. Which of these values is a proper assessment of the student's work is at the discretion of the grader - a student might only just meet the norms in the column (low end of the range) or perhaps might just fall short of the norms in the subsequent column (high end of the range). Note that grades can be provided up to a precision of half points.

| Qualitative descriptor | Grade range (inclusive) |
| :--------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Poor                   | 1 - 4                   |
| Insufficient           | 4.5 - 5.5               |
| Sufficient             | 6 - 7                   |
| Good                   | 7.5 - 8                 |
| Excellent              | 8.5 - 10                |
Please note that works that score higher than 8.0 are remarkable and that the grade 9 is reserved for the top 3% of students, while only the top 0.5% scores 10.
