Welcome to MBCS Projects, the online repository of the research master *Brain and Cognitive Sciences* (MBCS) at the University of Amsterdam. This page lists the manuals and other information for the individual projects within the programme, so that external parties (e.g. supervisors or assessors) can also access it.

If you are new to hosting or collaborating on our projects, please start by checking out the [[./Introduction to the Capstones|Introduction to the Capstones]].
