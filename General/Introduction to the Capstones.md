The Research Master Brain and Cognitive Sciences is an interdisciplinary master's programme that trains students from a wide range of cognition-oriented backgrounds to become researchers in neuroscience and/or cognitive science. 

Besides coursework, the students perform three individual projects. The combination of these three projects should prepare them well for a research career.

1. In ***Research Project 1***:
	- Students spend 4-5 months in a hosting lab to experience what it is like to use a particular method or analysis technique in the context of scientific research. 
	- Students write a technical report and give an oral presentation on their work. 
	- At the end of the project, students should have a good grasp of the acquisition and analysis methods that they used and should understand how their practical work fits into a broader theoretical context.
2. Subsequently, in ***Literature Thesis***: 
	- Students spend two months writing a synthesis of existing literature to deal with a self-identified problem statement
	- Students develop the skills to critically evaluate scientific literature. While for *Research Project 1* it was enough to understand a single theoretical framework that was applicable to the project, in the Literature Thesis they actively seek to compare and contrast different bodies of research, finding a problem that they can attempt to resolve. 
	- Students place their arguments in a multidisciplinary context, considering how their findings relate to other disciplines.
3. Finally, in ***Research Project 2***:
	- Students spend 6 - 7 months on a project in which they take more ownership than was the case for *Research Project 1*. 
	- Having the experience from the first project, as well as the ability to critically assess scientific literature, *Research Project 2* asks the student to think along with experimental design choices, choose acquisition or analysis methods and go through the full empirical cycle whenever that's realistic. 
	- The student prepares a journal article after this second project and holds a public defence of their work.

The combination of *Research Project 1* and *Research Project 2* should have the student personally engage with the following during experimental work:

- [ ] Data acquisition
- [ ] Formulation of research question/hypotheses
- [ ] Experimental design
- [ ] Collection/review of scientific literature
- [ ] Data analysis

In other words, if one of these components is missing from one project, it should be included in another project.
