Each of the individual projects taught within MBCS should be registered on Datanose. This is an action that should be performed by the student.

## Overall process
- Go to www.datanose.nl/#yourprojects
- Pick the corresponding project
- Fill in the details of the project

Registration includes a title for the project, as well as the staff that will be involved in supervision and assessment of the project and their affiliations. Registration also requires submission of the time period in which the project should take place.

Once a student has submitted a project registration, two things happen:

1. The programme reviews the information to check whether the project fits with the scope and requirements of MBCS.
2. The examiner that was listed during the registration confirms agreement to fulfilling that role.

Approval of the project means it is eligible for inclusion into the curriculum section of the student's Study Plan.

For *Research Project 1* and *Research Project 2*, there is another step after registration. One month after the **starting date** of the project (not to be confused with the registration date), the student is expected to submit a proposal that delineates the content and the planning of the project. See the following manual for more information:

- [[./Research Project 1 Manual|Research Project 1 Manual]]
- [[./Research Project 2 Manual|Research Project 2 Manual]]

## Uploading internship agreement
From 2023-2024 onwards, the project page also allows the student to upload an internship agreement. While the option is there for everyone, it only applies to those who have signed the UvA model agreement for internships. This agreement, formulated by the Universities of the Netherlands together with representatives from industry, exists to handle non-disclosure agreement and intellectual property clauses.

For more on this agreement, please see: https://student.uva.nl/en/topics/internship-agreement-and-arrangements

Students who do not have to sign for non-disclosure or intellectual property rights do not have to use this agreement and will therefore also not need to upload an agreement to their Datanose project page.
