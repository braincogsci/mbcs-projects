# Introduction
This manual concerns the module *Research Project 2* for students from the master programme *Brain and Cognitive Sciences* at the University of Amsterdam (UvA). This manual was written to inform all involved parties about the requirements of the research project and about their role, whether student, supervisor, assessor or examiner. 


>[!note]
>Students from *Brain and Cognitive Sciences* form a multidisciplinary group and enter internships at a wide range of hosting institutes. Some of them could work at logic departments, others might deal with fMRI data analysis and again others would do their work at neurobiology labs. These different hosts will emphasize different skills and knowledge, but all of them prepare the students for work as a researcher.

*Research Project 2* is the final capstone of the programme, in which students master practical research experience and demonstrate their ability to think independently within a scientific environment. Having passed this capstone means students are ready to enter a PhD programme. If you are not familiar with the structure of MBCS, please read the [[../General/Introduction to the Capstones|Introduction to the Capstones]] first.

## Learning objectives
During _Research Project 2_, the student is trained to reach several learning objectives. The below table lists these objectives, together with the corresponding exit qualification(s) of the master's programme. Note that *Research Project 2* is one of the final projects of the student and so successful completion means the student meets the exit qualifications that are listed here.

In addition to these, the student also brings a personal learning objective, which they identified during the reflection on Research Project 1. 

## Size of the project
Students can opt for a short project (36 EC) or a longer project (42 EC), depending on their earlier choice for *Research Project 1*. The total amount of credits a student can allocate to research projects has to be between 62 and 68 EC.

As 1 EC corresponds to 28 hours of work, the different sizes of *Research Project 2* can also be considered as listed in Table 1.

**Table 1** - Workload of different project sizes for *Research Project 1*

|Project size (EC)| Workload (hours) | Fulltime equivalent|
|:----: | :----:|:----:|
|36|1008|24 weeks|
|42|1176|28 weeks|

Note that full-time equivalence corresponds to a workload of 1.5 EC (42 hours) per week. Individual students might have a study plan that requires them to balance the project with one or more courses, in which case they can work less hours per week and will spend more weeks on the project.

## Pre-requisites

_Research Project 2_ is to be performed after _Research Project 1_. While the main objective of _Research Project 1_ is to train students to effectively work in an academic research environment, _Research Project 2_ also aims to train students to become independent researchers, and be able to both design research projects to address specific questions, as well as present their results to a broad scientific community.

In addition, it is important to note that _Research Project 1_ and _Research Project 2_ should deal with clearly distinct research questions and should be performed in different labs. _Research Project 1_ and _Research Project 2_ should preferably focus on different domains within brain and cognitive sciences. Students are however allowed to choose a similar topic/domain for both research projects.

It is not assumed that a student can go through all steps mentioned in learning objective #1 in any single project. However, at the end of both _Research Project 1_ and _Research Project 2_ the student is expected to have engaged with each phase in at least on of the two projects. In particular, data acquisition must be a component of at least one of the two research projects. 

# Formal setup of the project
## Roles
Each *Research Project 1* involves four different roles:
1. The **student** is the person who has ownership of the project and for whom the project is a learning experience
2. The **supervisor** is there to guide the student through the project and assist with the learning process by helping out to solve practical or theoretical difficulties
3. The **assessor** is one of the people grading the work of the student
4. The **examiner** also grades the work and is reponsible for submitting the final mark for the project. Examiners also monitor the quality of assessment, which is why they need to satisfy specific constraints (see later)

Good practice is to have the assessor and the examiner be from different environments, so that there is one *internal grader*, who is positioned within the hosting lab and one *external grader* who is not. Whether it is the examiner or the assessor who is internal to the hosting lab depends on the specifics of the project.

## Requirements
- The supervisor can be a PhD candidate or a more senior researcher who works in the hosting research group. 
- The internal grader should be a researcher within the hosting research group who has a doctorate degree (PhD). It is possible for a single person to take on both the supervisor and internal assessor roles, as long as the requirements for the internal grader are met.
- The external grader should be a researcher with a doctorate degree (PhD) from another group, who has relevant expertise (whether topic-wise or method-wise) to assess the final report that is written on the project.

As mentioned above, one of the two graders is labeled examiner, and this examiner holds responsibility for the quality of assessment. The examiner needs to:

1. be a UvA employee
2. have a doctorate degree (PhD) 
3. have basic teaching certification (BKO)

Table 2 summarizes the requirements and responsibilities of the different roles. Please note that for each grader, the tasks depend on whether they are internal or external to the lab where the project is taking place. The tasks are described in more detail later.

**Table 2** - Roles, requirements and responsibilities

|**Role**|**Requirements**|**Responsibilities**|
|:---|:--|:---|
|Daily Supervisor|<ul><li>Must be PhD candidate or a more senior researcher<li>Must be active in research group that hosts the internship</ul>|<ul><li>Assists in creating realistic project planning, corresponding to workload<li>Contact person for student questions<li>Provides feedback on overall performance and promotes scientific attitude<li>Joins midterm evaluation, together with student and examiner<li>Provides feedback on the draft version of the research report</ul>|
|Internal grader|<ul><li>Is located in same lab/research group as supervisor <li>Holds a doctorate degree (PhD). <li>Can be same person as daily supervisor, as long requirements for both roles are met</ul>|<ul><li>Monitors student performance in correspondence with supervisor</li><li>Grades experimental work, presentation and final report<li>Joins the [[./Public Defence|Public Defence]]<li>Joins the final feedback meeting</ul> |

>[!tip] Registering the roles on Datanose
> When all roles are identified, the student registers the project on Datanose and should list the assessor and an examiner, as well as whether the project is done internally (in the lab of the examiner) or externally (in a lab elsewhere). It is important this is done correctly. If an examiner cannot be selected from the dropdown menu in Datanose, this means the specific examiner has not been approved by the Examinations Board yet. See the section [[../Miscellaneous/Examiner|Examiner]] for information on how to request such approval. Please make sure the intended examiner meets the requirements listed in Table 2.

## Responsibilities

### Supervisor tasks
A list of tasks for the supervisor is shown in Table 3. Please note that hours for supervision scale with the size of the project. Table 3 gives an indication of how these hours could be distributed across tasks.

**Table 3** - Supervisor tasks with indication of hours

|Task|Hours on 36 EC project|Hours on 42 EC project|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Assist in project planning|8|8|
|Contact person|24|28|
|Ongoing feedback|12|16|
|Feedback on draft report|6|6|
|Miscellaneous|14|18|
|**Total**|**64**|**76**|

#### Assist in project planning
In the first month of the project, the student develops a research proposal and submits this to the programme. This proposal should be realistic and the estimated workload of the project should correspond to its EC count (see Table 1). The supervisor checks whether it is reasonable to expect that the planned project can be finished within the given time frame. 

>[!note]
> - Once the research proposal has been approved by programme and examiner, it is not possible to change the EC rewarded to the student upon succesful completion of the project.
> - The student may be combining the Research Project with coursework, in which case the student is not available full-time.

#### Be contact for student questions
The supervisor is the go-to person for the student, for any questions related to performing the research project. During the research project, the supervisor should be available to discuss problems within a reasonable time frame. When absent due to illness or leave, the supervisor should ensure that there is somebody else available for pressing questions of the student. At the same time, the **student** should display ownership of the project.

A good rule of thumb is for the supervisor to have at least one hour per week allotted to discussion with the student, either via a single meeting or via multiple short ones.

#### Ongoing feedback
The  supervisor guides the student and provides constructive feedback on his or her performance, whether that's mastering techniques, understanding key concepts, reflecting on ethical considerations or other aspects of work as a scientist. This feedback is important to improve the skills and knowledge of the student, and to foster an overall academic attitude.

If student and supervisor work closely together, then providing this feedback may happen quite naturally. If this is not the case, it is good to set out some time each month to discuss how things are going. One effective way to do this is by giving your opinion on where the students stands using the [[./Grading Rubrics Research Project 2|Grading Rubrics Research Project 2]] and giving constructive, actionable criticism.

#### Join Midterm Evaluation
Halfway through the project, a formal (online) feedback meeting takes place between supervisor and student, together with the examiner of the project. During this so-called Midterm Evaluation, the three parties discuss all progress so far, as well as performance and mutual satisfaction about the internship. This is an important opportunity for all parties to review how things are going. 

Also see: [[../Miscellaneous/Midterm Evaluation|Midterm Evaluation]]

#### Provide feedback on the draft version of the research report
One month before the end of the project, the student will submit a draft version of the research report. The draft version should be as complete as possible, to allow for effective feedback. The supervisor is expected to evaluate this draft report within a reasonable time frame and provide the student with constructive feedback.

---

### Internal grader tasks
The internal grader is expected to spend about four hours on the research project, distributed across a number of tasks.

#### Monitor the project
It is good practice to monitor the project, either via occassional check-ins with the supervisor or with the student. This is especially important to be able to assess the experimental work, as it might otherwise not be clear what the performance of the student is like.

#### Grade experimental work, presentation and final report
The internal grader is expected to grade all three assessment forms: the experimental work, the final presentation during the public defence and the final report, using the respective grading rubrics. These rubrics can be filled on the Datanose project portal when the time for assessment has come.  

#### Discuss and register the final grade
Before fully registering the grade, a feedback meeting between internal grader, external grader and student can clarify the assessment and discuss the main findings.

--- 

### External grader tasks
The external grader is expected to spend about four hours on the research project, grading the final report and in rare cases being available for an 'outside view' during the project.

#### Discuss and register the final grade
Before fully registering the grade, a feedback meeting between internal grader, external grader and student can clarify the assessment and discuss the main findings.

---

### Examiner tasks
'Examiner' is a label given to either the internal or external grader and tasks the respective person with a quality control role for assessment. In practice, this comes down to a number of tasks.

#### Reviews project plan
One month into the project, the student submits a research proposal via [www.datanose.nl](www.datanose.nl/#yourprojects) and once that proposal has been approved by the programme, the examiner will be asked to review it. In this process, the examiner is asked to judge the following:

- Is the planning of the project feasible for a master student?
- Is the design of the study appropriate given the research question and hypotheses?
- Is the plan of the student fitting for a master's level thesis project?

While reviewing the plan, it is possible to leave remarks that are visible to all parties involved in the project.

#### Join midterm evaluation
Halfway through the project, a formalized (online) feedback meeting takes place between supervisor and student, together with the examiner of the project. During this so-called Midterm Evaluation, the three parties discuss all progress so far, as well as performance and mutual satisfaction about the internship. 

The Midterm Evaluation is an important opportunity for all parties to review how things are going. Since the examiner may be an external grader, their contribution may be that of an outsider.

#### Assess public defence
The student will also give an oral presentation (max 20  minutes, plus max 10 minutes Q&A) about their Research Project during a public defence session. The program will organize several defence sessions during the academic year, during which 3-5 students will jointly present their projects in front of a broad panel, as well as their examiners. There are both on-site and online variants of such events.

For each student, at least the examiner or internal grader must attend the presentation. Students must indicate their intent to present their projects at least one month before the intended presentation date by contacting the programme assistant.

#### Guarantee validity of the grade
The examiner is expected to collect the grade(s) given by the assessor and to determine a final grade. This includes discussing the verdict with the assessor and establishing consensus if the first opinions about the final grade diverge by one grade point or more. In case of any doubts about the overall grade, the examiner can contact the MBCS programme coordinator for troubleshooting. Examples of such doubts may be:

* The assessor and examiner have conflicting opinions about the written report
* The (cross-validated) assessment of the report is very different from the assessment of the (non-validated) experimental work and/or presentation.

#### Submit the final grade
The examiner is expected to submit the final grade for registration via [www.datanose.nl](https://www.datanose.nl), using a link that is automatically e-mailed once the student has submitted the final report and assessment by both internal and external grader has been completed.

#### Discuss and register the final grade
Before fully registering the grade, a feedback meeting between assessor, examiner and student can clarify the assessment and discuss the main findings.

---
### Student tasks
As a research master student, the student enrolled in *Research Project 2* is expected to take the lead on his or her project. While all decisions and plans should be made in collaboration with the supervisor, the student is expected to display ownership of the project. The perfomance level is enumerated (relatively abstractly) in the grading rubrics of the project. The student is expected to meet agreements and deadlines set out in collaboration with supervisor, assessor(s) and the programme. These include setting up a work agreement at the start, writing a proposal, submitting documentation in time and scheduling the Midterm Evaluation.

The important deadlines are listed in Table 4.

### Submit a research proposal
The student is expected to register the project before starting it. We recommend to finalize registration at least one month before the starting date of the project.

After the starting date, the student has one month to prepare a research proposal that outlines the theoretical framework, design, research questions and hypotheses of the project. Note that while it may not be possible to go through all phases of the empirical cycle in a single project, the students is expected to have significant experience with all the following aspects once both _Research Project 1_ and _Research Project 2_ are done:

1. Formulating research question/hypothesis
2. Experimental design
3. Collecting/reviewing literature
4. Data acquisition
5. Data analysis

All these elements are required for *Research Project 2*, with the exception of data acquisition. This exception is only made if the student's *Research Project 1* already included data acquisition.

When submitting the research proposal, the student is asked to indicate which of these aspects are covered.

Even if you do not sign any non-disclosure agreements, the setup of your project, the results you obtain and any manuscripts you produce should be considered confidential until a relevant supervisor (usually the principal investigator of the group) has given you explicit approval to share particulars about the study you have been doing. This includes discussing the experimental design of your project without explicit approval, before the publication of the study.

### Schedule Midterm Evaluation Meeting
Halfway through the project, the student schedules a meeting with the supervisor and the examiner of the project. During this so-called Midterm Evaluation, the three parties discuss all progress so far, as well as performance and mutual satisfaction about the internship. This is an important opportunity for all parties to review how things are going.

### Provide draft version of the research report
One month before the end of the project, the student will submit a draft version of the research report. This report should be written in the format of a research article that is appropriate to the field in which the internship takes place (e.g. following the guidelines of a key journal), and it should clearly convey the work that the student has done. The draft version should be as complete as possible, to allow for effective feedback. The student can decide on the specific format in collaboration with the supervisor.

### Write Provide final report
The student finalizes the Research Project by submitting a written report which follows the structure and style of a journal that is relevant to the domain in which the student has worked. The student can decide on the specific format in collaboration with the supervisor. The report can be submitted via the project portal on Datanose. Note that the cover page of the report must follow the [[../Miscellaneous/MBCS Formatting Guidelines|MBCS Formatting Guidelines]].

### Perform public defence
The student will also give an oral presentation (max 20  minutes, plus max 10 minutes Q&A) about their Research Project during a public defence session. The program will organize several defence sessions during the academic year, during which 3-5 students will jointly present their projects in front of a committee composed of examiners and assessors for the research projects being presented. The committee should always consist of at least one of the graders for the project under consideration.

This means that for each student, either the examiner or the internal grader (or both) must attend the presentation for the purpose of assessment. Students must indicate their intention to present their projects at least one month before the intended presentation date, by picking a date using the dedicated form found on the Programme Canvas page. Other students from the programme are welcome to join a defence session.

>[!info] Remote participation
>Since *Research Project 2* takes place in many different countries and students may not be planning to return to the Netherlands after completing their degree requirements, the programme organizes both remote and physical sessions for the public defence.

### Reflect on the Research Project
While not part of the formal grading process, the student should finalise the research project by filling in the corresponding reflection form. This is done via the following link, which can only be accessed while logged in using a UvA account:

# Steps of the Research Project
In summary, the Research Project goes through several steps:

1.  Upon starting, once the hosting lab and the student have reached an agreement about the nature and conditions of the internship, the student registers the Research Project via Datanose ([www.datanose.nl/#yourprojects](www.datanose.nl/#yourprojects)). Here, the student submits who will be examiner and who will be the other assessor. Care should be taken when registering the project as *internal* (at UvA) or *external* (outside of UvA). In the case of internal projects, Datanose will assume the examiner is able to grade experimental work, presentation and written work. In the case of external projects, Datanose will assume the examiner can only assess the written work.
2.  The student then reads relevant literature and formulates research questions, hypotheses and an appropriate design in collaboration with the supervisor. This results in a Research Proposal, which the student submits again via Datanose, within one month after the starting date that was entered when registering the project. This proposal is reviewed by both the MBCS programme coordinator and the examiner of the project.
3.  In the subsequent months, the student will acquire and/or analyze the data relevant to the Research Project. At some convenient time within this phase, the student will schedule a Midterm Evaluation to discuss how the project is going with the supervisor and the examiner of the project.
4.  In the final month of the project (or earlier if the supervisor deems this appropriate), the student will draft a report on the conducted research, on which the supervisor provides feedback. This draft should be as definitive as possible, so that meaningful feedback can be given. The student may not submit multiple drafts.
5.  Based on the feedback on this draft, the student will submit a final version to Datanose, which will be graded by both assessors. 
6. The student will also give an oral presentation (max 20  minutes, plus max 10 minutes Q&A) about their Research Project during a [[./Public Defence|public defence]] session. The program will organize several defence sessions during the academic year, during which 3-5 students will jointly present their projects in front of a broad audience and a committee. For each student, at least one the two graders must take part in this committee. The presentation will be separately graded by committee members and an average grade will be calculated. Students must indicate their intention to present their projects at least one month before the intended presentation date.
7. To close off the project, student, internal assessor and external assessor (and optionally, the supervisor) meet for a final feedback meeting to discuss assessment.

# Grading
Grading is based on three components: the experimental work, the final report on the project and the oral presentation on the project. Table 5 summarizes the different components, their relative contribution to the final grade and the minimum grade required per component. If a component is graded less than this minimum score, the project as a whole should be registered as 'NAV' (i.e. requirements not met).

**Table 5** - Assessment forms

| Component |Contribution to final grade| Graded by| Minimum grade | 
|:--|:--:|:--|:--:|
|Experimental work|40%|Internal assessor |6.0|
|Final report|50% |Internal assessor and external assessor |6.0 |
|Oral presentation|10%|Internal assessor |6.0|

To grade the different components or to get a better idea about the expected level, please review the [[./Grading Rubrics Research Project 2|Grading Rubrics Research Project 2]].

The final report is graded by both the assessor and the examiner. Their grades are automatically averaged to arrive at a final score for the report, *except if the difference between their grades is more than or equal to 1 point*. In that case, the assessor and examiner are expected to discuss their considerations with each other and arrive at a consensus grade. If such consensus cannot be reached, the examiner should reach out to the programme via info-mcs@uva.nl. See [[../Miscellaneous/Grading Discrepancy|Grading Discrepancy]] for more information.

## Submitting the grade
Both the assessor and the examiner will receive an automatic e-mail once the student has submitted the final report to Datanose.nl. Through the link in this e-mail, they can grade the different components of the project. Once assessment is done, the examiner can then confirm the final grade, which is calculated as the weighted average of the average grades given by the assessors. Please note that the grade point difference between the two assessments of the final report should not be 1 or more. 

Upon confirmation of the grading, the examiner will be prompted with a grade registration form, available for digital signing using two-factor authentication. Please notice that the full workflow listed in the right hand of the Datanose page needs to be completed: that means first confirming the grade and then registering it.

Upon registration of the grade (through digital signature or processing by the programme), the student is immediately informed about the end result. We therefore kindly ask examiner and assessor to meet with the student to provide feedback and grading **before** submitting grades to Datanose. Please note that once grades are registered, they can no longer be edited. A rollback of the assessment form is only possible in case of too large a discrepancy between the two report grades.

# Miscellaneous issues

## Credits and delays
The credits listed when registering the project are those rewarded to the student. In principle, students do not receive more credits for extra time they put into the project if it is running late. As such it is important that a realistic time plan is made at the beginning of the project, to avoid a (costly) study delay for the student.

If a project exceeds the originally planned deadline by six months or more, the Examinations Board of the master’s programme may contact the internal assessor of the project for an explanation.

## Insufficient performance
As listed in table 5, there are minimum grades for all three assessment components. If a student receives final grades below these minimums, the project will be registered as ‘NAV’ (requirements not met) and the student will not be credited for the work.

Given the large size of the Research Projects, failing one will lead to a sizable study completion delay for the student. This means that if it becomes a clear a student might be heading towards an insufficient mark, it is important to explicitly inform the student about this (e.g. during the Midterm Evaluation). This way the student can either adapt performance accordingly, or choose to end the research project prematurely.

## Resit and repair options
At the halfway point of the research project, a Midterm Evaluation takes place that should establish the level of performance of the student and provide actionable feedback. The period after this Midterm Evaluation offers an opportunity for the student to improve where necessary.

If the Midterm Evaluation indicates that student performance is subpart, to the extent that the student will fail without improvement, this should be clearly indicated. The second half of the project can then be used by the student as an opportunity to "repair". If performance remains too low, the student can be considered to have failed this "repair" opportunity.

In exceptional cases, poor performance may only be noticed at a late stage. For example, the experimental work by a student might be in order, while the written report is wholly insufficient. In such cases, the student can be given the option to resubmit the written report as an option to repair. If this happens, the maximum grade that can be given for the report is a 6.0.

## Prematurely ending the Research Project
If issues arise that jeopardize the success of the research project and that cannot be remediated by feedback or reaching consensus between supervisor, examiner and student, please contact the programme via [info-mcs@uva.nl](mailto:info-mcs@uva.nl). 

The programme coordinator will meet with both the student and the daily supervisor (and, if appropriate, the examiner) to help decide on the best course of action.

Termination of the internship is only possible in two cases:

1. If the student, supervisor and examiner mutually agree on it
2. If the Examinations Board of the programme has reviewed the situation and has decided that termination is appropriate.

## Late submission of the research proposal
The Research Project Plan serves two goals:

1. It allows the programme to review the suitability of a given project, i.e. whether the project fits with the learning objectives of the course module *Research Project 1*.
2. It prepares the student for learning effectively during the research project, by guaranteeing that research questions, experimental design and methods of analysis/interpretation are explicitly considered by the student at an early stage of the learning process.

Both goals are served by timely submission of the proposal. In the case of goal 1, the possible scenario in which the programme rejects a proposed research project is extra costly for the student if the project has been ongoing for a relatively long time. In the case of goal 2, late submission may indicate that the student spent a relatively long time without clear plans or goals, which jeopardizes the learning process.

Therefore, the Research Project Plan must be submitted within 20 working days (about a month) after the starting date of the project. If submitted more than two weeks late, the Examinations Board considers the use of time within the project to have been inefficient. The registered starting date of the project will then be shifted to six weeks before the submission date of the (complete) Research Project Plan Form. This will also shift the ending date of the project accordingly.

Late submission of the Research Project Plan will not affect the grading of the research project, but the submission date of the final report cannot be before the ending date of the project.

## Delays in completing the Research Project
In case the deadline for final submission as registered on Datanose is not going to be met by the student and the delay is more than one month, the student should inform the  programme coordinator and the examiner and assessor of the Research Project, and supply the reasons for the delay. Based on this motivation, the examiner of the project may decide to set a new deadline together with the student or to request termination of the project.

## Registration date of the grade
At the Faculty of Science at the University of Amsterdam, grades for individual projects such as *Research Project 1* and *Research Project 2* are registered at the date of grade submission by the examiner. Note that the students should be actively enrolled for this grade registration. 

## Research Projects in non-academic environments
When _Research Project 1_ or _Research Project 2_ takes place in a non-academic setting, such as a company, NGO or governmental institute, it may not always be possible to find a supervisor or internal grader that meets the set requirements. In that case, the role of the examiner is extended: besides involvement in the proposal, Midterm Evaluation and assessment, the examiner will then regularly check on project progress. In these scenarios, it is important that supervisor, student and examiner meet with the MBCS programme coordinator to set up appropriate planning.
