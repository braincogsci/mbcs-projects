Argument mapping is the practice of schematically representing your [[../Skills/Argumentation|Argumentation]]. You start an argument map by writing down the claim you want to make in a distinct box and then you connect this to other boxes, which can represent:

1. Supporting reasons
2. Objections

The supporting reasons and objections can in turn have their *own* supporting reasons and objections. Writing down argumentation in this way can help you understand or structure it. While it is a cumbersome task, it clarifies thoughts and supports [[critical thinking|critical thinking]]. The effort it takes is a feature, which is an example of [[learning by friction|learning by friction]].

Still, there are digital tools that can be helpful to create neat argument maps. One example is the argument visualisation option of [Mindmup](https://www.mindmup.com/tutorials/argument-visualization.html). The below video shows how you can use Mindmup to create an argument map.

>Argument maps are not be confused with [[./Causal maps|Causal maps]], which are summaries of [[mechanistic explanations|mechanistic explanations]]. Where argument maps visualize lines of reasoning behind a specific claim, causal maps visualize explanations of a specific phenomenon.
