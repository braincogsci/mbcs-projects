For both Research Projects and the Literature Thesis, the first meeting between student and supervisor will be the time when mutual expectations are set. Here are some things students should definitely know about their intake meeting.

# Topics

## Goals
Each project has its own particular goals. Both the student and the supervisor will have things they wish to achieve and stating these upfront will smoothen collaboration. For example:

- The student might want to pick up on a particular skill and wishes to practice that as much as possible
- The supervisor might be aiming for publishing the results of the project
- The student might have a strict deadline for graduation
- The supervisor might have experiments or data analysis that need to be done within a given timeframe

Deciding on goals of the project is an important part of reaching an agreement. If a student is starting their *Research Project  2* they also bring a personal learning objective, which they identified during *Research Project 1*.

## Assessment
There are grading rubrics for all individual projects, but since they have been written to cater a wide range of projects, they may need further specification. During the intake, take the time to go through the respective grading rubrics together and resolve any unclarities about the phrasing.

For [[./Grading Rubrics Research Project 1|Grading Rubrics Research Project 1]] and [[./Grading Rubrics Research Project 2|Grading Rubrics Research Project 2]], it is also important to set weights for the different components. While it has been established that experimental work counts towards 40% of the grade, the presentation counts towards 10% of the grade and the report counts towards 50% of the grade, the partial weights of all the different aspects within each rubric is at the discretion of the assessors.

For example, in a project that is about analysis of existing data, all aspects related to data collection should not count for much, while all aspects related to analysis might be given special importance.

## Supervision
Make sure to discuss how supervision is organised. In some labs, students are working closely with supervisors and can ask questions at an ad hoc basis. In other labs, weekly meetings are the best solution. Some labs have shared communication platforms (e.g. Slack) while others do not. Being in the clear about how and how often supervisor and student are in contact is useful for further collaboration

# Materials
Students are requested to fill in a work agreement that covers the essentials and add it as an attachment to a comment on their [[./Datanose project page|Datanose project page]].
