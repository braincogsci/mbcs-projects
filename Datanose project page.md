All registered individual projects have their own project page on the website www.datanose.nl. 

Students create and review their projects via www.datanose.nl/#yourprojects. 

Note that:

- Each project has a unique URL, which can be accessed by all relevant parties. The page will adapt to your particular role (when logged in). This means that if anyone loses the project link as sent via e-mail, the student can relocate the link by navigating to their project via Datanose.nl.
- The rubrics of the individual projects only appear on Datanose once the time for assessment has come. To view the rubrics in advance (useful for students, but also for those preparing the [[Midterm Evaluation|Midterm Evaluation]]), please see:
	- [[./Grading Rubrics Research Project 1|Grading Rubrics Research Project 1]]
	- [[./Grading Rubrics Literature Thesis|Grading Rubrics Literature Thesis]]
	- [[./Grading Rubrics Research Project 2|Grading Rubrics Research Project 2]]
- All comments placed on the Datanose project page are visible to all parties, whether assessors, student or programme management.
- You can use the comments to add attachments to your page, such as the work agreement that was filled in after one of the [[./Intake Meetings|Intake Meetings]].
